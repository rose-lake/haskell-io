# haskell-io

## Examples and games dealing with IO in Haskell
- 'exercises' and 'chapters' reference Graham Hutton's text, 'Programming in Haskell'
- mastermind implementations created and extended collaboratively by our Recurse Center Haskell Study Group (m2'20, S1'20)
- currently in the middle of implementing a Haskell version of a two-player tic-tac-toe terminal game! :)
